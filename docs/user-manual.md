# User Manual

Welcome to the Infinity Comlog! This utility is designed to help you track your Infinity N5 games with minimal friction.

## Getting Started

1. **Pick Scenario**: Start your match by selecting the ITS mission from the dropdown. This will automatically set up the classified count and mission objectives.
2. **Choose List**: Confirm you have selected your army list.
3. **Lieutenant Roll**: Record who won the roll and what they chose (Initiative or Deployment).
4. **Setup**: Follow the deployment steps, including any special rule reminders (Infiltration, Hidden Deployment, etc.).

## Turn Tracking

The tracker is divided into 3 Game Rounds. Each round contains:
- **Your Turn / Opponent Turn**: Detailed phases (Tactical, Orders, States).
- **Round Scoring**: At the end of both players' turns, check off any objectives scored per round (like "Control the Beacon").

## Scoring

The **Finalise Scoring** section provides a summary of your performance:
- **Objective Points (OP)**: Calculated automatically based on your turn-by-turn progress and end-of-game objectives.
- **Victory Points (VP)**: Enter your final survived/killed points manually.
- **Tournament Points (TP)**: Calculated automatically based on the OP difference and your total OP.

## Attacker & Defender Roles

Some missions (like *Critical Intervention*) assign specific roles. 
- The **Attacker** is always the player who takes the **First Player Turn**.
- The **Defender** takes the **Second Player Turn**.
The app will dynamically update your objectives based on these roles once the turn order is decided.

## Tips
- Tap checkboxes to complete steps.
- Use the "Done" overrides if you want to skip sub-steps but mark a whole section as finished.
- All skills in the reference section link directly to the official wiki.
