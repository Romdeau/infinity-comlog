# ToDo Items

Things I want to implement.

## List View

- [x] Create feature branch `feat/army-list-view`
- [x] Update `UnitService` to enrich trooper data with full stats (MOV, CC, BS, PH, WIP, ARM, BTS, W, S)
- [x] Implement unit type mapping (LI, MI, HI, TAG, REM, SK, WB)
- [x] Create `ArmyListView` page with card-based layout
- [x] Register route and add sidebar navigation
- [x] Extract comprehensive ID-to-Name mappings for Skills, Weapons, and Equipment from `metadata.json`
- [x] Update UI to display human-readable names for all unit attributes
- [ ] Refine UI styling to match reference screenshot (colors, spacing, typography)
- [ ] Add unit logos/icons (using faction/unit metadata)
- [ ] Implement "Print" or "Export to PDF" functionality
- [ ] Handle complex unit profiles (multiple profiles, pilots, etc.)

## Future Ideas

- [ ] List Analysis Dashboard (Points distribution, specialist counts, etc.)
