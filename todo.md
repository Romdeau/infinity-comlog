# ToDo Items

Things I want to implement.



## List integration

The player should be able to input their infinity list code. The GitHub user twonirwana has a repository called Infinity-Data that contains logic for parsing these specific army codes

### Initial Integration

Based on the list code the player has inputted the app should then display the following information:

- The name of the list
- The faction of the list
- The points of the list
- The number of models in the list
- The number of wounds in the list

### Game Sequence Integration

Update the game sequence to include contextual assistance for the player. Provide a summary of units with special rules that impact deployment, such as hidden deployment, infiltration, forward deployment. Some units have multiple of these, so specifically highlight each unit and then list each of the special rules that they have for deployment. Additionally after this provide a 'Booty Reminder' item that prompts the player to roll their booty checks (which should only appear if the player has units with the 'Booty' special rule).
