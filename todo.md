# ToDo Items

Things I want to implement.

## List View



## General Documentation

- [x] Deep dive of `metadata.json` and faction data in `docs/metadata-structure.md`.

## Future Ideas

- [x] List Analysis Dashboard (Points distribution, specialist counts, etc.)
- [x] List Analysis Page (Dedicated page for list composition)
- [ ] List Comparison View (Side-by-side comparison of List A and B)
