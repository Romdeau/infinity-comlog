# ToDo Items

Things I want to implement.

## List View

Add a new page called "List View'. This page will display each unit from your chosen list with their full stats, equipment and skills. See the screenshot for an exmaple, but style this per to match this application. I'm not worried about images and icons for the moment, but if they're trivial to implement go for it. If not just use placeholders for the moment

## Future Ideas

- [ ] List Analysis Dashboard (Points distribution, specialist counts, etc.)
