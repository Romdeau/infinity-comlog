# Initial Concept
A specialized utility for players of Corvus Belli's **Infinity N5**. This application provides a streamlined game sequence tracker and a quick reference for common skills and AROs, directly linked to the official wiki.

# Vision
The Infinity Comlog is designed as a mobile-first, quick-reference companion for Corvus Belli's Infinity N5 tabletop game. Its primary purpose is to keep the game moving by providing a streamlined interface for tracking game sequences and scoring, reducing the need for exhaustive rulebook consultations during play.

- **Army Integration:** Leverage official army codes to provide unit-specific skills and equipment references directly within the tracker as contextual hints.
